# Blockchain DApp-Boilerplate
This is a demo DApp (Decentralized Application) that shows how easy it is to create a truly peer to peer marketplace, ***Used Samsung Mobile Marketplace***, on the Ethereum Blockchain  to search listings, create listings, purchase listings, and more. 

## 1. Connect to Private Blockchain in Metamask

-  Install [Metamask Chrome Browser Extension](https://metamask.io/).

- Click the Metamask icon in the toolbar, accept terms, and then click `Import Existing DEN`

- Enter the seed phrase (Mnemonic):
```
logic cradle area quality lumber pitch radar sense dove fault capital observe
```
This is the default seed phrase for truffle development.

- Click where it says "Ethereum Main Network" and select "Localhost 8545". Click the back arrow to return to your account:
	- http://52.197.90.86:8547 for http://52.197.90.86:3331/ eCommerce Used Phone
	- http://52.197.90.86:8546 for http://52.197.90.86:3332/ Insurance Flight Delay

 **Be careful not to mix up your test wallet with your real one on the Main Network.**

- You should see your first test account now has 100 ETH. (Address of `0x627306090abaB3A6e1400e9345bC60c78a8BEf57`) Additional generated accounts will also have this amount.

## 2. Connect to TestNet Blockchain

### 2.1. Set up Metamask

  -  Install [Metamask Chrome Browser Extension](https://metamask.io/).

  - Follow the instructions to set up your wallet.

  - Click where it says "Ethereum Main Network" and select "Rinkeby". This takes us off of the real ETH blockchain and onto the Rinkeby test net.

   **Be careful not to mix up your test wallet with your real one on the Main Network.**

### 2.2. Get some test ether

   - To get some Rinkeby ETH for creating or purchasing listings, visit the [this faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/).
